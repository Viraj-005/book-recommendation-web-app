# 📚 Book Recommendation Web App

Welcome to the **Book Recommendation Web App**! This project uses a pre-trained machine learning model to suggest books tailored to user preferences, providing a seamless and personalized reading experience.

## 🌟 Features

- **Personalized Book Suggestions**: Get recommendations based on a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Clean and user-friendly design to simplify book discovery.
- **Genre-Based Filtering**: Find books by genre, author, or title.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: No database needed — all recommendations are generated in real-time.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Pre-Trained Model**: The web app uses a machine learning model trained on a book dataset to predict user preferences.
2. **Select a book**: Users can select a book they like using the drop-down box, and the model recommends similar books.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: The app uses content-based filtering to find books matching the user's taste.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Heroku/AWS

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.4
- Django 5.1
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-web-app.git
   cd book-recommendation-web-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

## 📊 Machine Learning Model

The recommendation engine is powered by a pre-trained machine-learning model that uses content-based filtering to suggest books. The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset called Book-Crossing Dataset from Kaggle which contains books and user interactions to ensure high-quality recommendations.
